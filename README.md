- `gulp fonts`: converts fonts to woff, woff2 formats and moves all this to the **dist/fonts/** folder
- `gulp zip`: creates a .zip archive of the dist folder (the name is taken from the main project folder) and places it in the main project folder along with the dist and src folders
- `gulp webp`: converts images to .webp format.
